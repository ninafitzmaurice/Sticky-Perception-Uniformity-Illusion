# Sticky-Perception-Uniformity-Illusion
This code runs an experiment I developed to test perceptual stickiness of the uniformity illusion for my bachelor project. The uniformity illusion is a type of filling-in illusion whereby features across the visual field gradually become uniform in appearance with prolonged viewing. The uniformity illusion was first described by Otten et. al (2017). You can find more information about the illusion here: http://www.uniformillusion.com/.
